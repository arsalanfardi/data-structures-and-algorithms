    "##### Trees vs. Binary Trees\n",
    "A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children. Not all trees are binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/binary-tree.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many occasions where you may not want to have a tree that is a binary tree. For instance, for a tree representing phone numbers, you might use a 10-ary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree\n",
    "A **binary search tree** is a binary tree in which **all left descendents <= n < all right descendents**. This must be tree for each node n, including all of its descendents.\n",
    "- This definition can vary slightly with respect to equality, under some definitions the BST cannot have duplicate values. In others, the duplicates can be only on the right or on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/binary-search-tree.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Balanced vs Unbalanced\n",
    "A balanced tree does not mean that the left and right subtrees are exactly the same (that would be a **perfect binary tree**). In reality, a balanced tree means that it isn't *overly imbalanced*. It's balanced enough to ensure O(log n) time for insert and find, but not necessarily perfectly balanced. Two common types of balanced trees are red-black trees and AVL trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Perfect Binary Tree\n",

    "#### Tries\n",
    "A trie (sometimes called a **prefix tree**) is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node. Each path down the tree may represent a word. **\\* nodes** (null nodes) are often used to indicate complete words. \\* nodes might be special type of child (such as TerminatingTrieNode) or simply a boolean flag within a node. A node in a trie can have anywhere from 1 through ALPHABET_SIZE + 1 children (or 0 through ALPHABET_SIZE if a boolean flag is used instead of a \\* node). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use for tries is to use them for quick prefix lookups in O(k) time where k is the length of the string."
