    "#### Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure which maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. In a good implementation, the lookup time is O(1), however it can have a worst case of O(N) in the case that there are many collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple implementation of a hash table can involve an array of linked lists and a hash code function, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the key's hash code (which will usually be an int or a long) using the hash function. Note, different keys could have the same hash code due to an infinite number of keys and a finite number of ints.\n",
    "2. Map the hashcode to the index of an array. This could be done with something like hash(key) % array_max_length. Different hash codes could map to the same index.\n",
    "3. At this index, there is a linked list of keys and values. We use a linked list to account for collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of a hash table is shown below."
